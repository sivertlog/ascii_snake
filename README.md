# ASCII SNAKE
*by Sivert Log

## Dependencies:
- Install keyboard module
    - In terminal enter `pip install keyboard`

### For PyCharm
- Enable 'Emulate terminal in output console'  
*or*  
- Run in terminal  
  - In terminal enter `python snake.py`

## Notes:

I tried my best to only use what we've learned in class
up to this point. The two exceptions are keyboard input
and the `system('cls')` command to clear the terminal.
